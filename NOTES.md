### Training Notes

A React application is a collection of components (or objects).
Uses the single page application principle which refreshs components independently.

***Key elements***
- Variable (properties/fields/attributes etc...) stores data
- Function contains the code to execute
- Event created by user or browser (and others...)

#### Setting up a React project

- Ensure node is installed
- run command: `npm create vite@latest [app_name]`
- Open `http://localhost:...` in browser to view application

#### React app folder structure

- src 
	- App.jsx - contains first component
	- main.jsx
